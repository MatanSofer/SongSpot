Overview <br/>
In the era of readily available music content, identifying and curating relevant musical experiences for individual users can be a challenging task. Our mobile application addresses this issue by providing a tailored music experience that takes into account a user's location, age, and gender.

Key Features <br/>
The application works by identifying a user's current location (e.g., caf√©, gym) and, alongside considering their age and gender, classify the user into a certain group. Based on this classification, our application generates a customized playlist through Spotify, the leading music streaming application.

At the heart of our application is a unique song recommendation algorithm that automatically curates an optimal set of songs for the user.

User Interaction and Feedback <br/>
Our application leverages a database that holds over a million songs from Spotify, with each song having unique rating columns for each possible user classification based on location, age range, and gender.

Users have the capability to provide numerical feedback on the recommended songs. This feedback triggers our algorithm to recalculate the song's rating, allowing continuous improvement and refinement of our recommendation system.

Unique Value Proposition <br/>
This innovative blend of personalization and technology sets our application apart in the streaming app market. It offers not just an app, but a tailored musical journey, adjusting to the user's preferences, location, and personal characteristics.

Technological Tools and Programming Languages <br/>
The project incorporates a variety of technological tools and programming languages:
 <br/>
Spotify SDK
Spotify WEB API
Google Maps API
Big Query
Firebase Auth
The application is primarily developed using Java and Kotlin.

We welcome you to experience a music journey that truly understands and adapts to your taste and environment!
